#Hospital log result
The DCR graph result in "NursingWard_8_Result.png" was achieved by running the algorithm with a threshold of 100 %, the Hospital log the actor set as "Nursing ward" involved in each trace and a maximum trace-local alphabet of size 8. The last two settings are selectable in the algorithm's UI.

This results in a tiny section containing just 6 traces of the large hospital log.
The unfiltered log is in Hospital_log.xml.
